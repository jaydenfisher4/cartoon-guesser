        <h2>Welcome to the Cartoon Guessing Game!</h2>
        <p>Dive into the Cartoon Guessing Game, a thrilling and interactive <strong>animation quiz</strong> designed to test your knowledge of animated characters from classic and modern shows. Whether you’re a fan of SpongeBob, Aang, or Finn, this game offers a fun and challenging way to rediscover your favorite cartoons!</p>
        <h2>How to Play the Cartoon Guessing Game</h2>
        <p>The Cartoon Guessing Game challenges you to identify a mystery cartoon character one guess at a time. Here’s how it works: you start by typing the name of a character you think might be the answer. With each guess, the game reveals more clues about the correct character, helping you narrow it down until you either guess correctly, give up, or run out of attempts.</p>
        <p>After each guess, you’ll get feedback based on several categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network:</strong> The TV network that aired the show (e.g., Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network).</li>
            <li><strong>Show:</strong> The name of the cartoon series.</li>
            <li><strong>Main/Side:</strong> Whether the character is a main or side character.</li>
            <li><strong>Release Year:</strong> The year the show first aired, with hints if you’re close.</li>
            <li><strong>Still Airing:</strong> Whether the show is still producing new episodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> The character’s gender.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if you guess "SpongeBob" and the mystery character is "Aang," the game might reveal that you got the <strong>network</strong> right (both are from Nickelodeon), but the show, character type, and other details differ. These clues guide your next guess. In <strong>Daily Mode</strong>, you have 15 attempts to identify the character, while <strong>Unlimited Mode</strong> lets you keep guessing without limits.</p>
        <h2>Game Modes Explained</h2>
        <p>The Cartoon Guessing Game offers two exciting ways to play:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Mode:</strong> A new mystery character appears every day. You have 15 guesses to figure it out, making it a perfect daily challenge for cartoon fans.</li>
